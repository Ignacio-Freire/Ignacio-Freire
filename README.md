# Hello and welcome! 

## About me...

All around technology enthusiast, love spending hours and hours reading about the upcoming as well as our past. With around 10 years in COBOL and banking experience professionally I am constantly challenging myself on new technologies. Been using Python as a hobby for the past 6 years and lately, for the past 2 I've taken on succesfully several projects on Solidity.

Getting ready for Web3.0!
