# Hello and welcome! 

## About me...

All around technology enthusiast, love spending hours and hours reading about the upcoming as well as our past. With around 10 years in COBOL and banking experience professionally I am constantly challenging myself on new technologies. Been using Python as a hobby for the past 8 years and lately, for the past 3 I've taken on succesfully several projects on Solidity.

Ready for Web3!

## Career...

_**Core Solidity Developer at [@LossLess.cash](https://github.com/Lossless-Cash) [Aug 2021 - Ongoing]**_

Working on several products at Lossless aiming at making the blockchain ecosystem more secure. 

For prevention we’re continuously building Aegis, an early alert system which works by analyzing each transaction mined by a blockchain and applying various strategies and a machine learning model to determine its risk. Working both on-chain by pushing the risk scores and providing the ability to act directly and off-chain with notification systems. 

On-chain there we built two products aimed at hack mitigation, Lossless Core Protocol and Lossless Vault Protection System. Both of them interact with a main Lossless Controller to allow various features such as fun draining prevention, reporting on malicious transactions with the potential outcome of reverting it, staking on reports, etc.

Currently my focus is on Wrapped tokens which derive in two paths. Lossless Wrapped ERC20s which allow any token to be wrapped with Lossless Core Protocol, allowing easier integration. And WERC20 Extensible tokens which act as a new standard for wrapped tokens allowing the installation of smart contract extensions at any point without the need of redeploying the core smart contract.
