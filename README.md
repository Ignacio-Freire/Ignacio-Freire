## Career Highlights...

### Software Engineer at Olympix.ai [July 2024 - Present]
At Olympix.ai, I'm at the forefront of developing cutting-edge security tools for the blockchain industry. Our focus is on:
- Creating advanced tools for early detection of smart contract vulnerabilities
- Developing automated unit test generation systems for smart contracts
- Enhancing the overall security posture of blockchain projects
- Implementing machine learning algorithms to improve vulnerability detection accuracy

### Solidity Developer at Lossless [May 2021 - July 2024]
At Lossless, I played a key role in developing blockchain security products aimed at making the DeFi ecosystem more secure:
- Aegis: An early alert system that analyzes blockchain transactions in real-time, applying various strategies and machine learning models to determine risk levels.
- Lossless Core Protocol: An on-chain solution for hack mitigation, allowing for features like fund draining prevention and malicious transaction reporting.
- Lossless Vault Protection System: A complementary system to the Core Protocol, enhancing security for DeFi vaults.
- Wrapped ERC20 tokens: Developed Lossless Wrapped ERC20s to allow easier integration of the Lossless Core Protocol with existing tokens.
- WERC20 Extensible tokens: Created a new standard for wrapped tokens, allowing for the installation of smart contract extensions without redeploying the core contract.

Key responsibilities included smart contract development, recursive testing, hack/exploit mitigation and analysis, new feature implementation, audit interaction, R&D, and backend development using NestJS.
